# Introduction
OpenStreetMap is an open source, free map of the whole world, it is built by volunteer contributors under the open-content license.

OpenStreetMap allows free access to a community driven map which can be embedded into any website project, their only stipulation is that whatever project someone may use OpenStreetMap in, is that they are credited and the project falls under the Open Database License.

# Key features for our purposes 
* Open source: It is freely usable and only needs crediting
* Leaflet support: Leaflet is a widely used open source JS library which will help us draw over the map for easy visualization
* Community support: There is a huge community of dedicated people around the world who have used OpenStreetMap for their project so guides, documentation and examples are readily available.

# Usage
On this website OpenStreetMap will be deployed using Leaflet which will require the following:
* Including Leaflet’s stylesheet in our HTML
* Including Leaflet’s JS in our HTML
* Creating a container(div)
* Creating a script that actually displays our map
